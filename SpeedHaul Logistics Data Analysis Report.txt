SpeedHaul Logistics Data Analysis – Project Process and Plan
🧭 1. Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a data analysis simulation for SpeedHaul Logistics, a logistics and transportation company.

The goal was to:

Analyze delivery data to identify operational inefficiencies,

Develop data-driven insights to improve on-time delivery rates, fuel cost management, and customer satisfaction, and

Create a Power BI dashboard for performance monitoring.

🎯 2. Project Objectives

Examine delivery performance across routes and trucks.

Identify factors contributing to late deliveries and high fuel costs.

Analyze the relationship between delivery time and client satisfaction.

Create a dashboard that enables management to make real-time decisions.

Recommend data-driven strategies to enhance logistics operations.

🧩 3. Dataset Description

File: Data Set - SpeedHaul.xlsx

Column Name				Description
DeliveryID			Unique identifier for each delivery
TruckID				Unique ID assigned to each truck
Route				Delivery route or area
Average Delivery Time (hrs)	Average delivery time per trip
On-Time (Yes/No)		Delivery punctuality status
Fuel Cost (GHS)			Fuel expenditure per trip
Client Satisfaction (1–5)	Customer satisfaction rating
Packages Delivered		Number of packages per delivery

Data Size: 100 delivery records across 10 trucks.

⚙️ 4. Tools and Technologies
Tool						Purpose
Excel					Initial data cleaning and formatting
Python 					(Pandas, Matplotlib)	KPI computation and data visualization
Power BI				Dashboard development and interactive reporting
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)		Calculated measures for KPI tracking
GitHub					Version control and portfolio hosting

🔍 5. Project Process
Step 1: Data Cleaning (Excel)

Removed empty rows and standardized headers.

Checked for missing values and inconsistent entries in the On-Time column.

Converted numerical columns (Fuel Cost, Delivery Time) to numeric data types.


Step 2: Data Analysis (Python)

Performed preliminary analysis using Python:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_excel("Data Set - SpeedHaul.xlsx")
on_time_rate = df[df['On-Time'] == 'Yes'].shape[0] / len(df) * 100
avg_delivery_time = df['Average Delivery Time (hrs)'].mean()
avg_satisfaction = df['Client Satisfaction (1-5)'].mean()


This generated the base metrics later used in Power BI.

📊 6. KPI Design and DAX Measures (Power BI)
Created DAX Measures
KPI				DAX Formula						Description
Total Deliveries	Total Deliveries = COUNT('Table'[DeliveryID])		Total number of delivery records
On-Time Deliveries	On-Time Deliveries = CALCULATE(COUNT('Table'[DeliveryID]), 'Table'[On-Time] = "Yes")	Total successful on-time deliveries
On-Time Rate (%)	On-Time Rate (%) = DIVIDE([On-Time Deliveries], [Total Deliveries]) * 100	Percentage of on-time deliveries
Average Delivery Time	Average Delivery Time = AVERAGE('Table'[Average Delivery Time (hrs)])	Average time per delivery
Average Client Satisfaction	Average Client Satisfaction = AVERAGE('Table'[Client Satisfaction])	Mean satisfaction rating
Total Fuel Cost (GHS)	Total Fuel Cost (GHS) = SUM('Table'[Fuel Cost])	Total fuel expenditure
Average Packages per Trip	Average Packages per Trip = AVERAGE('Table'[Packages Delivered])	Packages handled per delivery

🧭 7. Dashboard Design and Layout

Navigation Buttons → Links between both dashboard pages



Navigation Setup:
Each page includes clickable buttons using:

Insert → Buttons → Action → Page Navigation
Buttons:

“Operational Insights” → links to Page 1

 8. Key Insights

65% on-time delivery rate, below the ideal 90% benchmark.

Trucks TRK102 and TRK107 have the longest average delivery times.

Fuel costs increase significantly on certain mid-length routes.

Client satisfaction drops sharply when delivery times exceed 4 hours.

Fleet utilization is uneven — some trucks are overworked.


🔧 9. Recommendations
Area				Recommendation					Expected Impact
Route Efficiency	Use Google OR-Tools for route optimization	Reduce fuel cost & delivery time
Fleet Management	Balance scheduling across trucks		Extend vehicle lifespan & reduce delays
Customer Transparency	Implement Real-Time GPS Tracking		Boost customer satisfaction & trust
Analytics Monitoring	Deploy a Power BI dashboard company-wide	Real-time KPI monitoring
Continuous Improvement	Conduct monthly data reviews			Maintain performance consistency
